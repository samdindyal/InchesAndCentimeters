# InchesAndCentimeters

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purose of this assignment is to take a user input in inches and convert it to a value in centimeters.

I have taken this a step further with a, live-updating, graphical representation, which also converts from centimeters to inches.
